## Executive Summary

Automna.ai is a hosted platform for fully agentic AI assistants powered by OpenClaw. Unlike ChatGPT or Claude Pro (which are just chat interfaces), Automna provides AI agents that **actually execute tasks**: browse the web, manage files, control integrations, automate workflows, make phone calls, send emails, and build and deploy apps.

**Value Proposition:** "Your own, private, fully autonomous AI agent. Working in 60s."

**Business Model:** Premium SaaS subscription ($20-299/month). All tiers feature-identical, differentiated by usage limits.

**Key Differentiator:** More than Claude Max ($100-200/mo) because we include:
- Fully managed cloud hosting (always on)
- Pre-configured integrations (Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, web, email, phone)
- Zero setup required
- Persistent memory, browser automation, scheduled tasks

## Target Users

1. **Creators/Influencers** — AI to manage DMs, schedule content, research
2. **Solopreneurs** — Assistant without hiring a human VA
3. **Developers** — OpenClaw without maintaining infrastructure
4. **Small Teams** — Shared AI workspace for research, support, automation
