### 👍 Tier 2 — Solid Podcast Targets

| # | Podcast | Host | Est. Audience | Est. Cost | Notes | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | **The Next Wave** | Matt Wolfe & Nathan Lands | ~100K | $1,000–$3,000 | AI tool discovery. Bundle with Matt's YouTube/newsletter. | ⭐ |
| 5 | **TWIML AI** | Sam Charrington | ~50K | $500–$1,500 | ML research/industry. Niche but credible. | 👍 |
| 6 | **How I AI** | Claire Vo | ~30K | $300–$800 | Hands-on AI tutorials. Affordable test. | 👍 |

### ❌ Podcasts to SKIP

| Podcast | Reason |
|---|---|
| **Lex Fridman Podcast** | Way too expensive ($50K+). Long-form interviews, not product placement. |
| **Lenny's Podcast** | Product/growth focus is adjacent but not AI-specific. $20K+ per episode. |
| **YC Startup Pod** | Institutional. Doesn't take outside sponsors. |
