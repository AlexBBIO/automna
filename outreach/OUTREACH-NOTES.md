# Outreach Notes

## What Worked (Batch 1 - Feb 6, 2026)

### Approved Style
- Short, direct, no fluff
- Specific product details: fully agentic, built-in email, browsing, phone calls coming soon, built on OpenClaw, dedicated server
- "Want a code?" as the CTA (not "login" or "access")
- Signed "– Alex" (simple, no title/company/url stack)
- Lowercase subject lines
- Each email has a unique hook tied to the person's content

### Key Lessons
- Don't offer "logins", offer "codes" (more exclusive)
- Don't presume they'll make content. "If you dig it, could be a fun X" not "I think this would make a great video"
- Be specific about what the product does. Vague = forgettable.
- "Took a lot of work" not "took months" or any specific timeframe
- Don't say "no setup, no servers" when it literally runs on a server
- End every message on a clear ask

### Batch 1 Targets (sent Feb 6)
1. Wes Roth - email + Twitter DM (warmest lead, OpenClaw singularity video)
2. Matthew Berman - email + Twitter DM (Forward Future OpenClaw episode)
3. 1littlecoder - Twitter DM only (Clawdbot setup video)
