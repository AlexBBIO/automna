**Personalized Hook:** N/A — do not cold email.

**Outreach Angle:** **Skip cold outreach.** Instead: (1) Engage on X/Twitter with technical content about OpenClaw architecture, (2) participate in Latent Space community discussions, (3) potentially get featured through organic use or if swyx discovers Automna naturally. Could also reach through mutual connections in the AI engineer community.

**Contact:** Do NOT cold email. Warm intro only or organic discovery.

---

It's the kind of product that bridges the gap between what your readers know is possible and what they can actually use."

**Outreach Angle:** Featured tool/product mention in daily email. Alpha Signal's audience is more technical/aware — lean into the OpenClaw foundation and open-source angle. Could also appear in their GitHub-tracking section if the repo gets traction.

**Contact:** Via datanorth.ai/news or contact form.

---

### 9. One Useful Thing (Ethan Mollick)

**Latest Content:** "Management as AI Superpower" (Jan 27, 2026) — argues that delegation, clear instructions, and feedback are the keys to leveraging AI agents. Previous: "Claude Code and What Comes Next" (Jan 7, 2026). Deeply influential voice in practical AI.

**Personalized Hook:** "Your 'Management as AI Superpower' thesis nails it — the skill of the future is knowing how to delegate to AI. Automna is built on exactly that principle: give everyone their own personal AI agent they can direct with natural language, one-click setup. We're making the management-to-agent pipeline trivially easy."

**Outreach Angle:** Academic/thought-leadership alignment. Mollick is a professor — don't pitch a product plug. Instead, pitch Automna as an interesting case study of "AI agents for the masses" that his audience of educators, students, and professionals would find intellectually interesting. He's more likely to mention tools he discovers organically.

**Contact:** Via oneusefulthing.org or UPenn email. Keep it intellectual, not salesy.

---

### 10. Import AI (Jack Clark)

**Latest Content:** Issue #438 (Dec 22, 2025): "Cyber capability overhang," "Robot hands for human use," "The plumbing required for AI chip design." Weekly deep-dive on AI research and policy. Jack is co-founder of Anthropic.

**Personalized Hook:** N/A — low probability of featuring a product.

**Outreach Angle:** **Deprioritize.** Import AI focuses on AI research, policy, and existential risk — not consumer products or tools. Jack Clark is Anthropic's co-founder. This newsletter is primarily a policy/research publication. Automna doesn't fit the editorial focus. Skip unless there's a policy/democratization angle that aligns.

**Contact:** Skip for now.

---

### 11. Simon Willison's Blog

**Latest Content:** "Distributing Go binaries via PyPI using go-to-wheel" (Feb 4, 2026); "A Social Network for A.I. Bots Only" (Feb 2, 2026) covering his NYT interview on OpenClaw and Moltbook; "Moltbook is the most interesting place on the internet" (Jan 30, 2026); "LLM predictions for 2026" (Jan 8, 2026). Prolific — 98 posts in July 2025 alone.

**Personalized Hook:** "Your recent coverage of OpenClaw and Moltbook shows you're tracking the consumer AI agent wave closely — Automna is built directly on OpenClaw, making it dead simple for non-technical users to get their own agent running with one click. You'd probably find the architecture interesting."

**Outreach Angle:** Technical discovery / organic mention. Simon writes about tools he personally uses and finds interesting. Best approach: make Automna technically interesting enough that he discovers it. Could also reach out on Mastodon (his primary social) with a genuine "built on OpenClaw, thought you'd find this interesting" note. He values open-source and transparency.

**Contact:** Mastodon (@simon@simonwillison.net) or blog contact. Keep it technical and genuine.

---

### 12. The Algorithmic Bridge (Alberto Romero)

**Latest Content:** "Weekly Top Picks #112: Besides Moltbook" — covers AI profitability, US-China geopolitics, privacy concerns, frontier models as "rapidly depreciating infrastructure." Previous: "Not With a Bang But a Wanker" (on Grok drama), "LEAKED: The Truth Behind Moltbook." 41K+ subscribers.

**Personalized Hook:** "Your analysis of frontier models as 'rapidly depreciating infrastructure' perfectly captures why we built Automna — instead of chasing the latest model, we give people a one-click personal agent on OpenClaw that stays current automatically. The infrastructure depreciates; the user's agent evolves."

**Outreach Angle:** Analytical/thought-piece feature. Alberto writes deep analysis, not tool roundups — pitch Automna as a case study in "democratizing AI agents" or the "consumer agent wave" thesis. He'd be more interested in the implications than the product itself.

**Contact:** Via thealgorithmicbridge.com or Substack DM.

### 13. Interconnects (Nathan Lambert)

**Latest Content:** "Thoughts on the job market in the age of LLMs" (Jan 30, 2026); "Arcee AI goes all-in on open models" (Jan 27, 2026); "Get Good at Agents" (Jan 21, 2026) — discusses how powerful AI tools require changes in scoping and managing work. 80 newsletters in 2025, 3.5M pageviews.

**Personalized Hook:** "Your 'Get Good at Agents' piece captures exactly the friction we're solving — people know agents are powerful but don't know where to start. Automna gives them a personal AI agent with one click, built on OpenClaw, so they can 'get good at agents' without the setup overhead."

**Outreach Angle:** Open-source / technical angle. Nathan is deeply invested in open models and the ATOM Project — lean into the OpenClaw open-source foundation. Position Automna as "open-source agents for everyone." His audience cares about open vs. closed.

**Contact:** Via interconnects.ai or X (@naborlam). Technical, open-source framing.

---

### 14. Why Try AI (Daniel Nest)

**Latest Content:** "240+ AI Tools That Defined 2025" — comprehensive categorized roundup of top AI tools; "My 7 AI Predictions for 2025: How Did I Do?" (Dec 18, 2025). Weekly, hype-free, practical guides for non-techies.

**Personalized Hook:** "Your '240+ AI Tools' list is the definitive resource — but what if your readers didn't need 240 tools and just needed one agent that handles it all? Automna gives them a personal AI agent with one-click setup, built on OpenClaw. Might deserve its own category in the 2026 edition."

**Outreach Angle:** Tool list inclusion + review. Daniel does comprehensive tool roundups and hands-on reviews — pitch Automna for inclusion in his next tools list or a dedicated review. His "hype-free, for non-techies" positioning perfectly aligns with Automna's "made for the masses" angle.

**Contact:** Via whytryai.com or Substack DM.

Your readers who loved that post but couldn't build their own would be the perfect users."

**Outreach Angle:** Workflow/systems feature or Maker Labs content. Wyndo writes about personal AI systems and agent workflows — Automna is literally "personal AI agent as a service." Pitch as a tool that gives his readers the AI agent system he built, without the building. Could also offer as content for Maker Labs (his paid tier).

**Contact:** Via aimaker.substack.com or Substack DM.

### 16. AI Agents Simplified — 21K+ subs

Also: "Mastering Open Source AI in 2026: Essential Decisions for Builders" (Jan 17, 2026) on open models reaching parity with proprietary.

**Personalized Hook:** "Your FOD#136 on the agent stack becoming 'real software' is exactly what we're building — Automna uses OpenClaw to turn the agent stack into a one-click consumer product. Memory, tools, system discipline, all baked in. No prompts needed."

**Outreach Angle:** Technical analysis / product case study. Turing Post covers AI infrastructure deeply — pitch Automna as an example of "agent stack becoming real software" for consumers. The open-source (OpenClaw) angle aligns with her "Mastering Open Source AI" series.

**Outreach Angle:** Anti-hype product review. Stuart's entire brand is cutting through AI hype — position Automna as "the un-hyped agent product that just works." He's new (3 weeks old), likely open to partnerships. Could also appear on his podcast for a "real product, no BS" conversation.

One-click setup, built on OpenClaw, already doing what your survey respondents are asking for."

**Outreach Angle:** Marketing use case feature or summit sponsorship. Marketing AI Institute is business/marketing-focused — pitch Automna through the "productivity for marketers" lens.

**Outreach Angle:** Founder interview. No Priors interviews AI company founders — pitch Automna's founder for an episode on "democratizing AI agents." Sarah and Elad invest in AI companies, so there's also a potential investor angle. Keep the pitch focused on vision, not just product.

**Outreach Angle:** Founder/builder interview. Nathan interviews AI builders and discusses products in depth. Pitch Automna's technical architecture (OpenClaw, per-user agents, one-click provisioning) for a deep-dive conversation. He'd appreciate the technical angle alongside the consumer accessibility story.

### 27. ThursdAI (Alex Volkov)

**Latest Content:** "Jan 29 — Genie3 is here, RIP Clawdbot" (Jan 30, 2026) — covered Genie3, Clawdbot/Clawd rebranding, Kimi K2.5, Chrome agentic features. Weekly Twitter Space + podcast. Active community.

**Personalized Hook:** N/A — likely not a fit for product plugs.

**Outreach Angle:** **Deprioritize.** Dwarkesh interviews CEOs, researchers, and deep thinkers about AI's trajectory. The show doesn't feature product demos or tool reviews. Automna wouldn't fit the editorial format unless there's a "democratizing AI" thesis-level conversation. Better to focus effort elsewhere.

**Contact:** Skip for now.

We've turned the agent stack into a one-click consumer product on OpenClaw. Your listeners who are trying to figure out how to actually deploy agents would love this."

**Outreach Angle:** Product interview or case study episode. Practical AI focuses on real-world AI applications — pitch Automna as a case study in "making agents practical for everyone." The "inside an AI-run company" angle could also work if Automna uses its own agents internally.

**Outreach Angle:** Founder interview. Craig interviews AI company leaders across sectors — pitch Automna's founder for an episode on "democratizing AI agents." He's an experienced journalist (former NYT) so keep the pitch honest, no hype. He'd appreciate the consumer angle alongside the technical architecture.
