## 2. AI Explained (384K) — AI Concepts
**Handle:** @aiexplained-official

**Recent Content:** Channel ranked as top AI YouTube channel of 2025 for balancing news, technical depth, context, and critical analysis. Known for deep SimpleBench analysis and superintelligence coverage. (Upload schedule appears sporadic/infrequent)

**Hook:** "Your channel stands out because you actually explain the *why* behind AI developments, not just the hype. Automna is an OpenClaw-based agent that democratizes personal AI — one-click setup for everyone. Would love to get your critical take on whether we've made the agent experience simple enough."

**Outreach Angle:** Appeal to his analytical nature. Frame it as "here's an agent platform worth critically examining" rather than a pure promo ask. His audience trusts his unbiased takes — a genuine review from him carries weight. Low upload frequency means he's selective; emphasize substance over flash.

## 3. Danilo McGarry (339K) — Creative AI / AI Strategy
**Handle:** @aimcgarry

**Recent Content:** "Danilo McGarry: AI Strategy Over Hype (NVIDIA GTC 2025)" (Jul 14, 2025) — talks practical AI adoption for businesses, reskilling developers, avoiding hype. Also grew his "It's all about Ai" podcast to 110K subs in 8 episodes.

**Hook:** "Your GTC talk on 'AI strategy over hype' resonated — too many tools are all sizzle, no steak. Automna is the opposite: OpenClaw-based agent, one-click deploy, and you're good to go. No hype, just a personal AI that works out of the box."

**Outreach Angle:** Anti-hype positioning. He's a keynote speaker and AI strategist who values substance. Frame Automna as practical AI democratization, not vaporware. His audience spans business leaders and creatives — both benefit from personal AI agents.

---

## 4. Yannic Kilcher (308K) — ML Papers
**Handle:** @YannicKilcher

**Recent Content:** "On the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval (Warning: Rant)" (Oct 11, 2025) — 49-min paper analysis. Also "AGI is not coming!" (Aug 9, 2025) covering OpenAI's open-source model and the shift to the "product era" in AI.

**Hook:** "Your point about AI entering the 'product era' in your AGI video is exactly what we're building at Automna — taking OpenClaw agents out of the dev terminal and into everyone's hands with one-click setup. Would love your take on the architecture."

**Outreach Angle:** Technical credibility. Yannic's audience is ML-savvy — they'll appreciate the OpenClaw foundation and want to understand the stack. Frame as a "product era" example worth analyzing. His community (Discord/Patreon) is highly engaged. Note: He's opinionated and won't shill — needs to genuinely find it interesting.

---

## 5. Nicholas Renotte (323K) — AI Coding
**Handle:** @NicholasRenotte

**Recent Content:** IBM keynote (Jun 2025) where he built AI agents with Langflow live. "How to Build a Stock Screener Agent with LangGraph in 30 Minutes" tutorial. Also "How to Create a Trading Bot (Without code) in 2025."

**Hook:** "Your no-code trading bot tutorial showed how powerful agent-based workflows can be when the setup is easy. Automna does the same for personal AI — one-click deploy of your own OpenClaw agent. Your coding audience would love to see what's under the hood."

**Outreach Angle:** Builder/tutorial angle. Nicholas does hands-on walkthroughs — offer him early access to build something on Automna and make a tutorial. His audience expects practical, follow-along content. Dual appeal: non-coders get the one-click setup, coders can explore the OpenClaw stack.

---

## 6. AI Foundations (299K) — Vibe Coding / AI Agents
**Handle:** @ai-foundations (Drake Surach)

**Recent Content:** "Deploy AI Agents to Your iPhone in Minutes" — quick deployment tutorial using n8n. Also "N8N Full Tutorial: Building AI Agents in 2025 for Beginners!" (Jan 31, 2025). Channel tagline: "The Quickest Path to Your AI Success!"

**Hook:** "You showed people how to deploy AI agents to their iPhone in minutes — Automna takes that even further. One click and you've got your own OpenClaw-based personal agent. No n8n config, no node setup. Just works. Perfect fit for your audience."

**Outreach Angle:** Direct competitor positioning as a simpler alternative. His audience already wants AI agents but struggles with n8n complexity. Automna removes the friction entirely. Offer a "compare and contrast" angle — n8n DIY vs. Automna one-click.

---

## 7. Nick Saraev (260K) — Make.com Automation
**Handle:** @nicksaraev

**Recent Content:** "US Lost 108K Jobs in Jan 2026, Most Gone Forever (AI)" (Feb 5, 2026). Also "how to transition from ai automation to agentic workflows" (Feb 5). **⚠️ WARNING: He released "Clawdbot Sucks, Actually" and "It Got Worse (Clawdbot)" videos criticizing Clawdbot/OpenClaw security (59K-159K views) — open ports, exposed API keys, supply chain attack demos.**

**Hook:** ⚠️ **PROCEED WITH EXTREME CAUTION OR SKIP.** He has publicly trashed Clawdbot/OpenClaw security. If approaching at all: "We saw your Clawdbot security videos — you raised valid points. Automna is built on OpenClaw but with a completely different security model: proxied API keys, per-user isolation on Fly.io, no exposed ports. We'd love to show you what 'OpenClaw done right' looks like."

**Outreach Angle:** Risky but high-reward. If he reviews Automna favorably after trashing vanilla Clawdbot, it's the strongest possible endorsement. But he could also roast it. Only approach if Automna's security story is bulletproof and you're ready for scrutiny. His audience is primed to care about this exact topic.

## 8. Julia McCoy (257K) — AI Content Marketing
**Handle:** @JuliaMcCoy (CEO of First Movers)

**Recent Content:** "Topview AI Video Agent: The Future of Viral Content Creation is Here" (Jan 22, 2026) — reviewing AI tool that recreates viral videos. Also "How to 25X Your Business with AI in 2025 (Complete Blueprint)."

**Hook:** "Your Topview review showed how AI tools can 25X content creation. Imagine pairing that with a personal AI agent that handles research, scheduling, and outreach automatically — that's Automna. One-click setup, OpenClaw-based, made for the marketing teams you serve."

**Outreach Angle:** Marketing efficiency. Julia's audience is content marketers and business owners who want AI to do more for them. Position Automna as the personal AI assistant that complements their content tools. She reviews AI tools regularly and has an AI clone — she's already bought in on the concept.

---

## 9. Ken Jee (276K) — Data Science
**Handle:** @KenJee_ds

**Recent Content:** "AI Will Take My Job. Here's 5 Things I'm Doing About It" (Dec 18, 2025) — personal strategy for thriving amid AI disruption. "How I Built a Profitable AI Product in 43 Days." Also building "Newsletter Hero AI" (SaaS product).

**Hook:** "Your '5 things I'm doing about AI taking my job' video hit hard — especially the part about building AI-powered businesses. Automna is exactly that kind of play: giving everyone their own AI agent, one-click deploy. As someone building Newsletter Hero, you know what accessible AI products look like."

**Outreach Angle:** Fellow builder angle. Ken is actively building his own AI SaaS (Newsletter Hero) so he understands the product space. Frame as builder-to-builder. His audience is data scientists pivoting to AI products — they're potential Automna users AND builders.

---

## 10. WorldofAI (193K) — AI News

**Outreach Angle:** News segment inclusion. WorldofAI covers AI tools and launches in digest format. Position Automna as a newsworthy launch they can feature. Low friction ask — just include it in a roundup. Contact: intheworldofai@gmail.com (public on channel).

---

## 11. David Shapiro (188K) — AGI Philosophy
**Handle:** @DaveShap

**Recent Content:** "The next step towards AGI" (Dec 26, 2025) — scaling paradox. "The AGI future is weirder than you realize" (Dec 22, 2025). "Where AI is going in 2026" predictions. Also writes on Substack ("Why AI is slowing down in 2026"). Focuses on post-labor economics and decentralized AI communities.

**Hook:** "Your post-labor economics work argues that AI should empower individuals, not just corporations. That's Automna's whole thesis — give every person their own OpenClaw agent, one-click, no dev skills required. It's the democratized AI future you've been talking about."

**Outreach Angle:** Philosophical alignment. David cares about AI democratization and post-labor society. Position Automna as a real-world implementation of his vision. He has an active Discord/Patreon community that would be early adopters. Note: He's building his own decentralized computing project, so frame as complementary, not competitive.

## 12. Robert Miles (168K) — AI Safety
**Handle:** @RobertMilesAI

**Recent Content:** "Using Dangerous AI, But Safely?" (~2025) — discusses safety metrics for untrusted AI code, red-teaming, monitoring. "Doom Debates" interview (Aug 23, 2025) on P(Doom), alignment challenges. Uploads infrequently but gets massive engagement. 53 videos total.

**Hook:** "Your work on 'using dangerous AI safely' is exactly the challenge we face with personal AI agents. Automna runs on OpenClaw with proxied APIs, sandboxed execution, and per-user isolation — we'd love your safety-focused perspective on our approach."

**Outreach Angle:** Safety credibility. Robert won't do a straightforward promo, but if Automna's safety model impresses him, a mention carries enormous weight with the AI safety community. Frame as seeking his expert assessment. Very selective about content — low probability but ultra-high value if it lands.

---

## 13. Nate B Jones (160K) — Cursor / AI Productivity
**Handle:** @NateBJones (channel: "AI News & Strategy Daily")

**Recent Content:** "THIS is Why You're Still Slow Even With AI (The Bottleneck Moved)" (Jan 15, 2026) — analyzes why users remain unproductive despite AI tools. "Why 2026 Is the Year to Build a Second Brain" (Jan 9). "The Compounding Gap That Makes 2026 the Last Chance to Catch Up" (Jan 1).

**Hook:** "Your 'bottleneck moved' video nailed it — the friction isn't the AI anymore, it's the setup and integration. Automna eliminates that bottleneck entirely: one-click deploy of your own OpenClaw agent. No Cursor configs, no terminal, no devops. The 'second brain' you're telling people to build, pre-built."

**Outreach Angle:** Productivity/second brain angle. Nate's audience is AI-curious professionals frustrated by setup complexity. Automna is literally the solution to the problem he identifies. He also runs a Substack — potential for a written review too. Very active posting schedule (multiple per month).

---

## 14. AI for Humans (150K) — Fun AI News Podcast
**Handle:** @AIforHumansShow (Kevin Pereira & Gavin Purcell)

**Recent Content:** "The AI Holodeck Just Got Real: Google's Project Genie" (Jan 30, 2026) — covers Google DeepMind's Project Genie AND discusses Clawdbot. "Google's AI Knows Everything About You (We Said Yes)" (Jan 16, 2026). Weekly Thursday episodes.

**Hook:** "You guys already covered Clawdbot in your Holodeck episode — Automna is built on that same OpenClaw stack but made for the masses. One-click setup, no terminal needed. Would love to demo it on the show and let Kevin and Gavin react in real-time."

**Outreach Angle:** Live demo / entertainment. This podcast thrives on "try it live" moments. They already know about Clawdbot — Automna is the consumer-friendly version. Perfect for a segment where they set up an agent in one click on air. High entertainment value for their format.

---

## 15. Franklin AI (72K) — AI Tool News
**Handle:** @FranklinAI (franklineh.com)

**Recent Content:** "Flova AI is the ONLY Video Tool You Need in 2026" (Feb 4, 2026). "I Can't Believe this AI Tool is FREE! | invideo VISION" (Jan 31, 2026). "The Only AI Agent You Need in 2026 | Full Genspark Tutorial" (Dec 25, 2025). Posts weekly tool reviews.

**Hook:** "Your Genspark tutorial was titled 'The Only AI Agent You Need in 2026' — we think Automna might challenge that claim. OpenClaw-based, one-click setup, and it's YOUR agent, not a shared service. Would love for you to compare them."

**Outreach Angle:** Direct tool review. Franklin reviews AI tools weekly — this is his bread and butter. Frame as "review this and tell your audience what you think." The "only AI agent you need" framing from his Genspark video creates a natural comparison. He includes affiliate links and discount codes — the free sub + tokens offer fits perfectly.

## 16. 9x Agency (54K) — No-Code AI Agents
**Handle:** @go9x

**Recent Content:** "How to Build AI Agents with n8n in 2025! (Full Course)" — 5+ hour comprehensive free course on building agents with n8n (agentic workflows, Gmail/Airtable agent, calendar agent, classifiers). Upcoming webinar on Enterprise Knowledge Retrieval (Feb 12, 2026).

**Hook:** "Your 5-hour n8n agent course is incredible — but imagine if your audience could skip all that setup and have a personal AI agent running in one click. That's Automna: OpenClaw-powered, pre-configured, done. We'd love to partner with you on a 'build vs. buy' comparison."

**Outreach Angle:** "Build vs. buy" comparison. 9x teaches people to build agents from scratch — Automna is the turnkey alternative. Not competitive; complementary. Their audience learns the concepts from 9x, then uses Automna for personal deployment. Offer a joint webinar or comparison video.

---

## 17. Mikey No Code (95K) — No-Code Apps
**Handle:** @mikeynocode

**Recent Content:** "Claude Code Tutorial for Beginners: Build App with AI" (Jan 25, 2026) — building a complete app using Claude Code with exact prompts shown. "How I Use AI To Build A $10000 App (No Coding + Beginner Friendly)" (Nov 20, 2025). Recommends Base44 as AI app builder.

**Hook:** "Your Claude Code tutorial showed how easy it is to build apps with AI. Automna is literally built on the same OpenClaw/Claude stack — but instead of building apps, you're deploying your own personal AI agent in one click. Your no-code audience would love this."

**Outreach Angle:** Same-stack familiarity. Mikey already teaches Claude Code — Automna runs on OpenClaw (Clawdbot). His audience understands the ecosystem. Position as "you've built apps with Claude Code, now give yourself an always-on Claude agent." Natural fit.

---

"LLM-driven in-context adaptive learning" (Sep 7, 2025). 300+ projects shared, heavy Patreon community. Appears less active recently.

**Hook:** "You've shared 300+ AI projects with your community — each one requiring setup and config. What if your audience could have a personal AI agent handling that kind of work for them, deployed in one click? Automna is OpenClaw-based and built for exactly the tinkerers in your community."

**Outreach Angle:** Builder/tinkerer community. EchoHive's audience is hands-on developers who love building with APIs. Smaller channel but highly engaged (Patreon, Discord). Position Automna as a project they can build on top of — both use it and extend it. The API-first nature of OpenClaw appeals to this audience. Lower reach but high conversion potential.

## ⚠️ Key Alert: Nick Saraev / Clawdbot Videos

Nick Saraev published **"Clawdbot Sucks, Actually"** (59K-159K views) and **"It Got Worse (Clawdbot)"** documenting security vulnerabilities in Clawdbot/OpenClaw:
- Open ports exposing user data
- Unauthorized access to user profiles and API keys
- Message history extraction and doxxing
- Supply chain attacks via MoltHub (fake backdoor skill got 4K+ downloads)
- Port scanning finding 900+ unprotected instances

**This directly impacts Automna's pitch.** Any creator who's seen these videos will have concerns. Ensure the outreach emphasizes Automna's security model:
- Proxied API keys (no real keys on user machines)
- Per-user Fly.io isolation
- No exposed ports
- Gateway token auth

Consider proactively addressing this in all outreach, not just Nick's.
