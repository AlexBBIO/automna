# Outreach Email Rules

## Inbox Monitoring
- When checking for replies, **skip messages with the "done" or "ignore" label**
- Label threads "done" once a conversation is resolved or handed off
- Label junk/test messages "ignore" to permanently filter them
- Only flag genuinely NEW, unhandled inbound replies from outreach targets

## The Problem
AI-written emails are instantly recognizable. They kill response rates. These rules exist to prevent that.

## Dead Giveaways (NEVER DO THESE)
1. **Feature lists in parentheses** — "(browses, emails, files, research)" screams template
2. **"Would love to"** — the most AI phrase in existence
3. **"No strings attached"** — nobody believes this
4. **"Happy to"** — filler, adds nothing
5. **"Nailed it" / "stuck with me" / "resonated"** — fake compliment energy
6. **Formulaic structure** — compliment → pitch → ask, every single time
7. **Explaining what the product does in a paragraph** — they'll check the site if they care
8. **Formal sign-offs with title/company/url stacked** — reads like a sales sig
9. **"I'm building X"** as an opener — founder-brained, nobody cares yet
10. **Perfect grammar, perfect flow, zero personality** — too clean = fake
11. **"Dedicated infrastructure"** or any enterprise jargon in casual outreach
12. **Starting with "Hey [Name],"** + immediate compliment — the AI cold email starter pack

## Rules
1. **50-80 words max.** If it scrolls on mobile, it's too long.
2. **One idea per email.** Don't pitch AND ask for a demo AND offer access.
3. **Sound like a text from a friend who happens to work on something cool.** That's the vibe.
4. **The compliment must be SPECIFIC.** Not "loved your video" — reference a specific moment, opinion, or take they had. One sentence max.
5. **Don't explain the product.** Tease what it does in one line. Link does the rest.
6. **The ask should be easy.** "Mind if I send you a login?" beats "Would you be open to scheduling a call?"
7. **Vary your structure.** Don't start every email the same way. Some can start with a question. Some with a bold claim. Some with a shared observation.
8. **Use contractions.** "I'm" not "I am." "You're" not "You are." "It's" not "It is."
9. **One casual sign-off.** Just a name. Maybe a dash before it. No title, no company, no URL in the sig (URL goes in the body if needed).
10. **Read it out loud.** If you wouldn't say it to someone at a bar, rewrite it.
11. **Imperfection is fine.** A slightly informal sentence, a dash instead of a period, starting with "So" — these are human.
12. **Never use the same template twice.** Each email should feel like it was written for that one person, because it was.
13. **Subject lines: short, lowercase-friendly, curiosity or connection.** Not "Quick idea for [Company]" — that's in every cold email guide and everyone knows it.
14. **No exclamation marks in the first email.** Calm confidence > forced excitement.
15. **No em dashes.** Use commas, periods, or line breaks instead. Em dashes are an AI tell AND Alex hates them.
16. **Don't presume they'll make content.** Lead with "try it," and only softly suggest content as a possibility IF they like it. Never assume they'll review/feature/cover you.
17. **Offer a "code" not a "login."** Sounds more exclusive and less like SaaS onboarding.
18. **Be specific about what Automna does.** Fully agentic, built-in email and browsing, built on OpenClaw, phone call support coming soon. Don't be vague.
19. **Don't say "no setup, no servers."** It runs on a server. Saying otherwise is misleading and reads like marketing copy.
20. **Avoid false precision.** Don't say "took months" or "been building since X." Just say it took a lot of work.
21. **No negative framing.** Don't say "not a wrapper," "not a chatbot," "not a toy." Just say what it IS. Defining yourself by what you're not is weak positioning.
