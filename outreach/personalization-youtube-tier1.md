## 1. Matt Wolfe (@mreflow, ~895K subs)

**Recent Content:**
- "AI Benchmarks Are Lying to You (I Investigated)" (Jan 28, 2026) — deep-dive into the unreliability of AI benchmarks
- "AI News: AI Takes Control in January!" — covered Anthropic's prompt improver, AI website builders via voice, and Perplexity browser

**Personalized Hook:**
"Your benchmarks investigation nailed what we all feel — you can't trust leaderboards to tell you what's actually useful day-to-day. Automna skips the benchmarks debate entirely: it's a personal AI agent (built on OpenClaw) that just works out of the box. One click, you have your own agent. No setup wizardry, no prompt engineering required."

**Best Angle:** Tool review / demo. Matt loves testing AI tools hands-on and showing what actually delivers vs. the hype. Position as "here's a tool that lives up to its promise — try it and show your audience."

## 2. The AI Advantage — Igor Pogany (417K subs)

**Recent Content:**
- "Claude Cowork Is Taking Over & More AI Use Cases" (Jan 16, 2026) — covered Claude Cowork, ElevenLabs Scribe v2, Midjourney Niji 7

- Channel/book acquired by Tony Robbins & Dean Graziosi; focuses on AI literacy for normal people

**Personalized Hook:**
"You called agentic AI the defining trend of 2026, and you're literally writing the book on making AI accessible. Automna is the practical version of that thesis — a personal AI agent anyone can set up in one click, no technical background needed. It's built on OpenClaw and designed for exactly the audience you're educating."

**Best Angle:** Audience fit / tutorial integration. Igor's whole mission is making AI practical for everyone — Automna is the product version of what he teaches. Could be a great "here's what an AI agent looks like in practice" tutorial.

Automna would be perfect for one of those walkthroughs: it's an OpenClaw-based personal AI agent with one-click setup. Your viewers can literally follow along and have their own agent running by the end of the video."

**Best Angle:** Tool demo / tutorial. TheAIGRID excels at step-by-step tool walkthroughs. A "set up your own AI agent in 5 minutes" video is right in their wheelhouse.

Automna takes a different approach: instead of choosing between tools, you get your own personal AI agent (built on OpenClaw) that handles things for you. One-click setup — no comparing models, no prompt engineering, just tell it what you need."

**Best Angle:** Tool comparison / review. Skill Leap could position Automna alongside ChatGPT/Gemini as "here's the agent option" — a natural extension of their comparison content.

**Best Angle:** Narrative alignment / exclusive story. Wes is ALREADY talking about OpenClaw — this is the warmest lead on the list. He can position it as "I told you about the technology, now here's the product built on it."

- Mentioned Nano Banana Pro for workflows and LM Arena for video model comparisons

Open-source power, zero setup friction."

**Best Angle:** Open-source narrative / tool review. MattVidPro already covers open-source AI trends — Automna fits as a concrete product emerging from the open-source explosion he's documenting.

We'd love to give you a full demo and let you show your audience what OpenClaw looks like as a consumer product."

**Best Angle:** Direct connection / demo. Matthew already had OpenClaw on his show! This is the second-warmest lead after Wes Roth. He can do a hands-on demo showing the product side of what he discussed on his livestream.

## 8. AI Jason — Jason Zhou (213K subs)

**Recent Content:**
- "UI Design is Changing Forever!" — covers how designers are becoming AI-integrated builders
- Known for hands-on AI agent builds (email agent, Cursor AI product builds, DeepSeek R1 review)
- Focus on AI agents + startups + rapid prototyping

**Personalized Hook:**
"Your AI agent experiments are exactly what Automna productizes.

Your audience of builders and startup founders would eat this up: it's the fastest path from 'I want an AI agent' to actually having one."

**Best Angle:** Builder/startup angle. AI Jason's audience builds things — position Automna as both a product to use AND a platform to study. "Here's how they made an AI agent accessible to everyone."

## 9. AI Andy — Andy Hafell (213K subs)

- Notable experiment: used Suno AI to create and release a full lo-fi hip-hop album via DistroKid to streaming platforms
- "Happy New Year 2026" short — still active on the channel

**Personalized Hook:**
"Your AI music experiment proved something powerful — AI tools are ready for real creative output, not just demos. Automna takes that same philosophy to personal AI agents: built on OpenClaw, one-click setup, and suddenly everyone has their own AI assistant. No coding, no configuration — just like how you went from Suno to Spotify without being a musician."

**Best Angle:** Tool tutorial / accessibility narrative. Andy's brand is about showing non-technical people how to use AI tools — Automna's one-click simplicity is perfect for a "look how easy this is" tutorial.

Your creative audience would love having an AI agent that handles the non-creative work so they can focus on filmmaking."

**Best Angle:** Creator productivity angle. Dan's audience is AI-curious creators — position Automna as "the AI agent that handles your non-creative tasks (research, scheduling, writing) so you can focus on what you love: making films."

- Covers scraping with Bright Data MCP, SEO strategies, ad revenue from directory sites

One-click setup, then it works for you. Perfect for the 'set it and forget it' income model your viewers love."

**Best Angle:** Automation / business tool. Position Automna as the AI agent that automates the boring parts of running AI-powered businesses. Their audience wants to make money with AI, not babysit tools.

Your viewers who found Clawdbot intimidating will love this, and the technical ones will appreciate how it's architected. Would make a great follow-up to that video."

**Best Angle:** Direct technical follow-up. 1littlecoder's audience ALREADY knows about Clawdbot/OpenClaw. Automna is the natural "here's the easy version" sequel. This is the third-warmest lead on the list.

Your developer audience would appreciate both the product AND the architecture: how we turned an open-source framework into a scalable consumer product."

**Best Angle:** Builder/architecture angle. Corbin's audience wants to build AI products — Automna is both a tool they can use and an example of how to productize open-source AI. Two hooks for the price of one.

No SDK, no API keys, no infrastructure decisions. The agentic future you've been predicting, packaged for everyone."

**Best Angle:** Technical credibility / thought leader endorsement. Sam is the most technical creator on this list — his endorsement carries weight with developers. Position as "the agentic framework that actually ships to consumers."

It'd slide right into your next tools roundup as 'the AI agent that doesn't require a PhD to set up.'"

**Best Angle:** Tools roundup inclusion. Aitrepreneur does regular "best AI tools" compilations — getting Automna featured in one of these is the goal. Low friction ask: "include us in your next roundup."
